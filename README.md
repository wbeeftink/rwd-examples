# Responsive webdesign

This repository contains the source code for the examples used in our presentation about responsive webdesign at the TYPO3 congress 2012 in Almere.

Presentation by:

* Vincent Kessels
* Wouter Beeftink [@wbeeftink](https://twitter.com/wbeeftink)
* ROQUIN [@ROQUINwebsites](https://twitter.com/ROQUINwebsites)

## Examples

This repository contains these examples:

* `grid_fixed.html` - A fixed grid
* `grid_fluid.html` - A fluid grid
* `image.html` - A non-flexible image
* `image_flexible.html` - A flexible image
* `video.html` - A non-flexible video
* `video_flexible.html` - A flexible video using FitVids.js
* `grid_fluid_media_queries.html` - A fluid grid with media queries

All examples were tested to work in all modern browsers. To get media queries to work in IE8 and lower you'll have to include a polyfill like [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond).

## Presentation

The presentation will be recorded and will be available after the congress. We will also post our slides somewhere. I will update this readme when the information is available.

**Note:** The presentation is in Dutch.

## TypoScript

The TypoScript used to strip images of inline styles as shown during the presentation will be added later.
